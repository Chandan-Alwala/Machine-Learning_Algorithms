# Machine-Learning_Algorithms

This repository contains two Python scripts for machine learning:

## ID3 Algorithm Implementation
File: id3variant.py <br>
Description: This script implements the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for decision tree classification. It calculates the entropy and conditional entropy to partition a dataset into subsets based on the most informative attributes.

## TensorFlow-based Neural Network
File: tensorflow.py <br>
Description: This script demonstrates the creation of a neural network using TensorFlow. It includes layers with different activation functions, regularization, batch normalization, and dropout. The neural network is trained on provided training data and evaluated on testing data.
