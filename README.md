# Machine-Learning_Algorithms

This repository contains two Python scripts for machine learning:

## ID3 Algorithm Implementation
File: id3variant.py <br>
Description: This script implements the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for decision tree classification. ID3 is a widely used algorithm for building decision trees based on information gain and entropy calculations. The script takes an input dataset and computes the entropy and conditional entropy of each attribute to determine the most informative attribute for partitioning the dataset. The modified dataset is saved to an output file.

## TensorFlow-based Neural Network
File: tensorflow.py <br>
Description: This script demonstrates the creation of a simple neural network using TensorFlow, a popular deep-learning framework. The neural network architecture includes multiple layers with different activation functions, regularization techniques, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The script loads training and testing data from CSV files (x_train.csv, y_train.csv, x_test.csv, y_test.csv) and trains the neural network on the training data. It then evaluates the model's performance on the testing data, displaying accuracy and loss metrics, along with plots to visualize the training process.
