# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repository contains code and resources related to various ML tasks. The project is organized into three main folders, each serving a specific purpose:

## 1. ID3_Algorithm

The `ID3_Algorithm` folder contains code and resources related to partitioning datasets using ID3_Algorithm. 

## 2. NeuralNetwork

The `NeuralNetwork` folder focuses on tasks related to  equipment failure prediction using Neural Network concepts. 

## 3. SVM

The `SVM` folder focuses on tasks related to  equipment failure prediction using SVM concepts.
